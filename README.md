Thank you for sharing the image of the simple todo list web app. Here's a sample README file that could accompany this project:

# Todo List App

This is a basic todo list web application that allows users to add tasks, mark them as complete, and remove any unnecessary excuses.

## Features

- Add new tasks
- Mark tasks as complete
- Remove tasks and their associated excuses

## Usage

1. Enter a task in the input field and click the "Add" button to create a new task.
2. Click the "Done" button next to a task to mark it as complete.
3. If you want to remove a task and its associated excuse, simply click the "Done" button.

## Technical Details

This web app was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The user interface is simple and straightforward, with an intuitive layout and clear functionality.

The app stores the task list in the browser's local storage, so the tasks will persist even after the page is refreshed or the browser is closed.
